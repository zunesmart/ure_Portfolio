            <p class="lead text-dark" >Rent Own Pro was A project I worked on at the very end of my undergrad In Web and UX.
                The purpose was to redesign this website. This website is mobile friendly and Is colored
                bright and open to attract customers. The of this website colors are simple and based off of the original 
                logos given to designers to use in this project.  There was really only one good one for use 
                that matched the description of the lovely homes sold by Rent Own Home Pro. So, I chose 
                their suggested logos and went to work.

            <p class="lead text-dark" >The outcome of this front-end site I thought was pretty good considering the time given to
                complete this project. I believe to code this it took only a few weeks and did
                not run into much difficulty until I figured it was better to change a few things. The first
                thing I changed was the bootstrap custom modal Carrousel. I felt like the regular bottom
                dashes need to be changed to something else. It took me some testing but I was eventually was
                able to customize it. Another thing was the home cards were dark. The home cards weren't as bright
                and outgoing as they should have been. So, I had to do a redesign of simplifying and making it so
                the homes would stick out better and that the text on the card was well displayed.
